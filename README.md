### Why do they look so bad?

I guess because there is not a simple structure of **what is a pokemon**. Every one is quite different from the other. For example, faces, they have quite similar structure (eyes, mouth, nose, ...) and a lot of variations. Pokemons only have variations and no similar structure. Thats pretty hard for a GAN to learn. But that's just a guess.
